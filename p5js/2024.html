                <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/mckep039/full/N-0Z8r9Qr"></iframe>
                <p>First thing I did was import a png of my face. I drew it in afobe illustrator. When I typed the image into the code, it was way to big! I had to chage its hight to 50,50 to fit my screen.
                    I then needed to figur out how to include the randome() funtion. I wanted the x,y cordinates of the image to choose a random a random point between 0-300. Thats where I defined the x and y variable to do.</p>

                <p>I Remember having a lot of fun with this code. I guess this week I was feeling especially morbid as I made my clock about death. Emo art can still be fun though!</p>

                <p>This assignment I teamed up with Isabel again. We both had so much fun drawing out characters. I drew the squid man, and she drew the odd green man. I thought Isabel's character was so funny I really enjoyed playing with the genorator.</p>

                <p>My friend who is super good at coding was in town and I went to him asking for help on understading forloops better and how to revize my assignment. He starting telling me about Conway's game of life and how it can be recreated in p5.js!It was very interesting working with my friend and how he helped me with the step by step process of putting together all the code.I would love to credit Conway and Peter for this assignment as they were the true reasons this code came together :>. </p>

                <p>What did you learn about yourself through the process of self-tracking?:
                    I learned how much anxiety still effects me and my ability to focus, and enjoy my day to day. I catch myself having looping thoughts and worries, and I don't even relize how much it effects me! 
                    
                    I lined out my emotions in a line that rotate in a clockwise direction to repersent me moving worward in time, but when you click the sketch starts to quickly rotate in the oposate direction. The neon magenta squares repersent my anxiety. Yes, everyday I experience an emotion outside of anxiety, but that doesnt mean I still axious! I also wanted to give a looping effect to the squares, because looping thoughts with axiety.

                <p>This game I had a lot of fun making the art for. Drawing to get the running animation to work was horrible. Over my winter break I want to go back and find a more effeciant way to code the running animation.</p>
